# AssignmentBackend

Run the application from VS2022, the dotnet run command needs some more tweaking regarding the ports.

Just set the Assignment.API as the starting project which is in Presentation folder.

This is the basic solution that solves the assignment. It uses mediator pattern. I could add much more to this project, but these are the basic requirements.
